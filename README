1. INSTALLATION: 
The package provides a (Distutils) 'setup.py'
to build and install it. Just 
 % python setup.py install [--user]
The --user option is used when you don't 
have root privilegies (or you don't want
to install the package in the global 
site-packages directories). The package
will be installed inside of the user 
directory '$HOME/.local'. You have to modify 
the enviroment variable:
 % export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/.local/lib
 % export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin
in order to use the new scripts and modules
